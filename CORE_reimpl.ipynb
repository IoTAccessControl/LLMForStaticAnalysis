    "\n",
    "You are a program-analysis assistant. Please perform a **static** analysis of “information flow” on a given code snippet, treating each branch or loop condition as potentially taking any outcome, without using semantic or symbolic execution to prune paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Information Flow Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "An **information flow** from variable `x` to variable `y`, written `x -> y`, exists whenever information stored in `x` is transferred to or used to derive information transferred to `y`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We denote each variable instance as `(var,lineNumber)`, meaning the variable `var` is **defined or updated** at `lineNumber`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Direct Flows\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direct Explicit Flow**  \n",
    "  A direct explicit flow occurs when the value written by one variable instance is directly used in computing the value of another, through operations like assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Formally, if `(varA, lineA)` writes a value and `(varB, lineB)` reads that value to compute its own, then there is a **direct explicit flow** from `(varA, lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)`, written as: `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example 1**:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    1  x = 5\n",
    "    2  y = x + 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    `(x,1) -> (y,2)` is a direct explicit flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example 2**:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    1  x = 5\n",
    "    2  if cond:\n",
    "    3      y = x + 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    `(x,1) -> (y,3)` is a direct explicit flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Under static analysis, we treat **each conditional or loop as potentially taking any outcome**, and we **do not perform semantic pruning**. Therefore, even if the statement at line 3 is conditionally executed, we still recognize `(x,1)` as used to compute `(y,3)`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direct Implicit Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "  A direct implicit flow from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB, lineB)` occurs when `(varA,lineA)`’s value directly influences whether `lineB` executes. In other words, it corresponds to a **direct control dependence**, where the condition has **at least one branch** where `(varB, lineB)` must run and another where it may not. All conditional structures (e.g., if, while, for, switch, etc.) generate these flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Formally, if `(varA,lineA)` is **directly read** in a condition at `lineC` and that condition **directly** decides whether `lineB` executes, then we say there is an **direct implicit flow** from `(varA,lineA)` to `(varB,lineB)` (or `(varA,lineA) -> (varB,lineB)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  1  z = x + 5\n",
    "  2  if z > 1:\n",
    "  3      y = 10\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  `(z,1) -> (z,2)* -> (y,3)` is a direct implicit flow through the condition at line 2. Line 2 is a conditional statement and the value of `(z,2)*` here is not redefined, therefore marked with \"*\".\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The asterisk * indicates that the variable is used for the conditional statement but not redefined at that line (e.g., used in a condition).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information Flow Between Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "An **information flow** exists from a variable `(varA, lineA)` to another variable `(varB, lineB)` if there is a **transitive chain of direct flows** — explicit, implicit, or both — connecting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, there exists a sequence of variables:\n",
